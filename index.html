            <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h2><br>
            <P>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</P>
            <br><h2>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h2><br>
            <P>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know <br>it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</P>
            <br><h2>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h2><br>
            <P>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</P>
